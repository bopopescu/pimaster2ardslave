# This tests that the Raspberry Pi and Arduino can talk to each other, and
# doesn't require any sensors or additional hardware other than the IÂ²C
# between the two boards. Communication is over address 0x08, so be sure
# that is not being used by another device. For the test to function be sure
# to set the 'isEchoTest' flag on the Arduino's i2cSubordinate.ino sketch to true,
# otherwise it won't echo the requests but rather respond to them.
#
# This requires installation of pigpio, e.g.:
#
#   % sudo pip3 install pigpio
#
