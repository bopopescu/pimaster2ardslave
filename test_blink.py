# This test blinks an LED connected to pin 5 of the Arduino. This requires 
# a Raspberry Pi connected to an Arduino over IÂ²C on address 0x08. Because
# an LED cannot directly handle a 5 volt supply you should connect the LED
# to ground through a resistor of about 330 ohms. The exact value will
# depend on the dropping voltage of the LED (which varies) and how bright
# you want it to appear.
#
# This also requires installation of pigpio, e.g.:
#
#   % sudo pip3 install pigpio
